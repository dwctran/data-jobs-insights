WHY YOU‘LL LOVE WORKING HEREThey are made up of a bunch of creatives, entrepreneurs and tech-\xaddriven individuals. They’re far from the straight\xadlaced corporates that you might imagine pulling the strings behind healthcare companies. They represent a new breed of healthcare companies, at the forefront of revolutionizing how people receive medical treatment. They were founded in the midst of COVID\xad19, and in a matter of 6 months, they've grown to thousands of patients and hit over 7 figures in Annual Run Rate. They have also been featured on Augustman, FM91.3, Vulcan Post, e27, etc. They see themselves continuing to grow to all new heights and therefore are looking for someone with the skills to help us meet the technological demands that come with it. You will be joining a young startup in a growth phase and you will also be working remotely (they don't intend to get an office anytime soon). This means a couple of things: Flexible schedule. You will have a more flexible schedule but you will also have to be prepared to fight fires at odd hours when you least expect. Pull your own weight.There'll be no hand-\xadholding and they expect you to pull your own weight \xad like everyone else. Things get messy. There's no sugarcoating this. Things are unstructured and processes might be lacking. They're not where they want to be but they're getting there. You must be able to thrive in ambiguous situations (see point above). You are willing to put in the time to get the most out of any opportunity. Building a strong team is key in our ambition to thrive as a company, as co\xad-workers, and as individuals. Therefore, they are looking for someone similarly dedicated and passionate, willing to put their best foot forward (go all stakes in) and take pride in what they do, because they do too. If you are interested in joining us at this point in our journey and are someone who enjoys sticking their hands in the dirt and putting in the work to see something grow, then you’re one of us.

Marketplace  The experiment you will be working on is a marketplace to help customers discover Xendit’s products.

WHY YOU‘LL LOVE WORKING HERE They are made up of a bunch of creatives, entrepreneurs and tech-\xaddriven individuals. They’re far from the straight\xadlaced corporates that you might imagine pulling the strings behind healthcare companies. They represent a new breed of healthcare companies, at the forefront of revolutionizing how people receive medical treatment. They were founded in the midst of COVID\xad19, and in a matter of 6 months, they've grown to thousands of patients and hit over 7 figures in Annual Run Rate. They have also been featured on Augustman, FM91.3, Vulcan Post, e27, etc. They see themselves continuing to grow to all new heights and therefore are looking for someone with the skills to help us meet the technological demands that come with it. You will be joining a young startup in a growth phase and you will also be working remotely (they don't intend to get an office anytime soon). This means a couple of things: Flexible schedule. You will have a more flexible schedule but you will also have to be prepared to fight fires at odd hours when you least expect. Pull your own weight.There'll be no hand-\xadholding and they expect you to pull your own weight \xad like everyone else. Things get messy. There's no sugarcoating this. Things are unstructured and processes might be lacking. They're not where they want to be but they're getting there. You must be able to thrive in ambiguous situations (see point above). You are willing to put in the time to get the most out of any opportunity. Building a strong team is key in our ambition to thrive as a company, as co\xad-workers, and as individuals. Therefore, they are looking for someone similarly dedicated and passionate, willing to put their best foot forward (go all stakes in) and take pride in what they do, because they do too. If you are interested in joining us at this point in our journey and are someone who enjoys sticking their hands in the dirt and putting in the work to see something grow, then you’re one of us.

265,Magento Developer,Freelancer,Vietnam,,,,"[""Magento developer (PHP) – 3500$  Company Our company was founded in 2007, and today more than 100 people work here. The development office is in Ukraine, with the sales office located in the USA. We have been closely working with Magento since 2014, and today Magento team has about 30 people. Before COVID-19, working from the office was mandatory. Now the vacancy is remote and we are open to foreign candidates. Moreover, we can provide you with both full (monthly salary) and part-time employment (wage per hour). About our Magento directions:  Primary requirements: • PHP5, MySQL, JS, Magento 1, 2 We work with many different clients on various projects. Thus, our developers may choose the projects that suit them in terms of their skills level and which they find the most comfortable. Conventionally, our Magento department work may be divided into the following areas: 1. The first direction may be the most interesting for the guys who prefer pretty challenging tasks and switching between them. We are an exclusive partner for a number of companies that develop their own extensions and solutions for Magento. We receive a lot of challenging leads both for revising the existing modules and creating the new ones. The most challenging tasks we have been involved in recently are: \uf0b7 cryptocurrencies integration; \uf0b7 non-trivial payment systems integration; \uf0b7 POS terminals integration; \uf0b7 mobile solutions development (PWA, cross-platform and native); \uf0b7 working on marketplaces. 2. The next direction may be suitable for the guys who prefer to be involved in a well-defined development process We are involved in a number of long-term enterprise projects, e.g. we work with the companies that: \uf0b7 wholesale air conditioners (wholesale only) and employ more than 100,000 people; \uf0b7 design and manufacture orthopedic mattresses, and sell them all over the world (this year 30 new countries have been covered); \uf0b7 own a large store in Canada that sells equipment to corporate customers only. Working on such projects is carefully planned, all tasks and processes are documented and the team is divided by their tasks. 3. The following direction is good for people who prefer to work on a well-known source code. Since we have a lot of projects to support, their working processes are well established. Emergencies are extremely rare, while global changes are usually planned and carried out at the usual pace. 4. One more direction is aimed at people who would like to work on a project from the ground, starting from the original task, developing the architecture, and delivering the project turnkey. This is due to the fact that our sales are focused on Magento direction and one of their searching vectors is convincing customers to migrate from other e-commerce platforms to Magento.  About our projects: We work with numerous clients under white labels. However, some customers insist on strict NDA, and we are not able to disclose any information about particular projects. Here you may find some projects we can tell you about and which we are especially proud of: bit.ly/M_projects About projects not related to Magento: Apart from Magento skills, we highly appreciate a desire to delve into new technologies and frameworks. So, for example, now we have a number of projects on Robotium, Apple TV (TVMLJS), and Go. Some developers switched to these projects from PHP / JS. \uf0b7 Some teams work according to Agile methodology. \uf0b7 Some developers work as Dedicated to a specific project/client. \uf0b7 Some work on Fixed Cost base. \uf0b7 Some teams require communication with clients via E-mail / Ticket system. \uf0b7 In some teams, verbal communication is required (a PM helps in case developers have difficulties with English) \uf0b7 In some teams, all communication goes through the PM and one does not have to communicate with the client directly. Thus, the working environment in the teams is different, since we try to provide the most comfortable conditions for our developers inviting them to those projects/teams which they find the most enjoyable. We do not usually insist on direct communication between developers and customers. However, we are glad to provide our developers with an opportunity to communicate with customers directly. Benefits \uf0b7 Working time: EU time zone. We are 5 hours ahead of you ~ 1 PM - 9 PM Vietnam time (later is better). Though if the guy is onboarded to the US or Au clients, he might work closer to Vietnam working time \uf0b7 Annual leave day: For the local developer, we provide a full set of hardware when/if necessary. Though with the abroad devs it might be a problem, cause sending the hardware abroad won't have a benefit. There is a place for negotiations, though (e.g. I may compensate hardware) \uf0b7 We offer paid sick leaves \uf0b7 14 working days of the vacation (if not used, then compensated at the end of the year) \uf0b7 Constantly salary grow and bonuses \uf0b7 We pay courses if they are preliminary agreed Interview process: 1 round with Technical Lead  How to apply  Sent Cv and resume to: th.hienhr@gmail.com Zalo: 0336596120 / Phone : 0981127348  Show more Show less""]"

Our mission is to offer Vietnam’s most talented technologists a platform to connect with some of the world’s leading tech companies and build their expertise on a global scale. Over 4 years, Fetch has built a good reputation and is trusted by many Vietnamese and foreign companies; And Fetch will continue its good work to bridge the divide between the World and the Vietnam Tech sector. b. About our client At this company, they believe that the future of healthcare is online and at home rather than in the clinic or in the pharmacy. They run two specialised digital health brands that make good healthcare accessible and affordable for all. Meet A and B — the telemedicine platforms of the 21st century. About A & B A is Singapore’s first digital men’s health platform. It’s an inclusive, discreet space that provides treatment for stigmatized yet common conditions in sexual health, aesthetics, and overall well-being. B is a supportive and judgment-free platform that empowers women to take charge of their overall well-being, including everything from sexual health to aesthetics, hair and mental health. RESPONSIBILITIES They are hiring a front\xadend engineer to help build the most iconic digital men’s clinic in Southeast Asia and reach our beautiful potential. The mission is to provide men with a safe haven for all things men’s health, whether it’s making discreet, affordable, and convenient alternatives to receiving treatment more accessible to men, or raising awareness and acceptance of some of the more private conditions that men may feel embarrassed about. You’ll be involved in building the most ambitious digital healthcare platform in the region. You will work with the marketing team to create marketing assets (e.g. landing pages on web flow and marketing emails) REQUIREMENT At least 2-\xad3 years experience in frontend development Strong knowledge of HTML, CSS, SASS, and Javascript/Typescript. Good English communication. Startup experience. You will have a huge passion for startups and fast\xad growing teams. You will have been part of the journey of a successful startup. WHY YOU‘LL LOVE WORKING HERE They are made up of a bunch of creatives, entrepreneurs and tech-\xaddriven individuals. They’re far from the straight\xadlaced corporates that you might imagine pulling the strings behind healthcare companies. They represent a new breed of healthcare companies, at the forefront of revolutionizing how people receive medical treatment. They were founded in the midst of COVID\xad19, and in a matter of 6 months, they've grown to thousands of patients and hit over 7 figures in Annual Run Rate. They have also been featured on Augustman, FM91.3, Vulcan Post, e27, etc. They see themselves continuing to grow to all new heights and therefore are looking for someone with the skills to help us meet the technological demands that come with it. You will be joining a young startup in a growth phase and you will also be working remotely (they don't intend to get an office anytime soon). This means a couple of things: Flexible schedule. You will have a more flexible schedule but you will also have to be prepared to fight fires at odd hours when you least expect. Pull your own weight.There'll be no hand-\xadholding and they expect you to pull your own weight \xad like everyone else. Things get messy. There's no sugarcoating this. Things are unstructured and processes might be lacking. They're not where they want to be but they're getting there. You must be able to thrive in ambiguous situations (see point above). You are willing to put in the time to get the most out of any opportunity. Building a strong team is key in our ambition to thrive as a company, as co\xad-workers, and as individuals. Therefore, they are looking for someone similarly dedicated and passionate, willing to put their best foot forward (go all stakes in) and take pride in what they do, because they do too. If you are interested in joining us at this point in our journey and are someone who enjoys sticking their hands in the dirt and putting in the work to see something grow, then you’re one of us.

WHY YOU‘LL LOVE WORKING HEREThey are made up of a bunch of creatives, entrepreneurs and tech-\xaddriven individuals. They’re far from the straight\xadlaced corporates that you might imagine pulling the strings behind healthcare companies. They represent a new breed of healthcare companies, at the forefront of revolutionizing how people receive medical treatment. They were founded in the midst of COVID\xad19, and in a matter of 6 months, they've grown to thousands of patients and hit over 7 figures in Annual Run Rate. They have also been featured on Augustman, FM91.3, Vulcan Post, e27, etc. They see themselves continuing to grow to all new heights and therefore are looking for someone with the skills to help us meet the technological demands that come with it. You will be joining a young startup in a growth phase and you will also be working remotely (they don't intend to get an office anytime soon). This means a couple of things: Flexible schedule. You will have a more flexible schedule but you will also have to be prepared to fight fires at odd hours when you least expect. Pull your own weight.There'll be no hand-\xadholding and they expect you to pull your own weight \xad like everyone else. Things get messy. There's no sugarcoating this. Things are unstructured and processes might be lacking. They're not where they want to be but they're getting there. You must be able to thrive in ambiguous situations (see point above). You are willing to put in the time to get the most out of any opportunity. Building a strong team is key in our ambition to thrive as a company, as co\xad-workers, and as individuals. Therefore, they are looking for someone similarly dedicated and passionate, willing to put their best foot forward (go all stakes in) and take pride in what they do, because they do too. If you are interested in joining us at this point in our journey and are someone who enjoys sticking their hands in the dirt and putting in the work to see something grow, then you’re one of us.

476,"Software Engineer, Customer Success",WordPress VIP,Da Nang Metropolitan Area,"Online Audio and Video Media, Software Development, and Internet Publishing",Engineering and Customer Service,Mid-Senior level,"['About WordPress VIP  WordPress VIP (WPVIP), the enterprise division of Automattic, is the world’s leading agile content management platform. Our suite of open solutions and services brings the ease and agility of WordPress to the heart of the largest enterprises in the world. Our large and growing ecosystem of technologies, services, and integrations is designed to bring the freedom and power of open source to our customers, which include Facebook, The New York Times, Salesforce, and hundreds more.     About the Role  The Customer Success Software Engineer role is responsible for ensuring our customers’ ultimate technical success in scaling, building, and deploying world-class applications on top of our powerful platform. In this diverse, customer-facing role, you will provide technical and architectural consulting and advice to customer teams and leadership; solve complex, often mission-critical problems with customer deployments and applications; promote platform knowledge and feature adoption to our customers; and propose, design, and build the tools and processes that power our business.     As an integral part of a support or consulting squad at WPVIP, you’ll focus on our customer’s technical needs and goals. But you’ll also have ample opportunity to contribute to WPVIP’s platform and the open-source tools (including WordPress core) that we build upon. We encourage periodical rotation to one of our product teams in order to contribute to the platform. In addition, the role includes continuous opportunities to ship code and solutions as part of one of our many project squads.     About You  You are an engineer with a drive for real-world outcomes. You may have a background as a full-stack product engineer, or as an engineer in enterprise or media — but you are ready to roll up your sleeves and work directly with a wide spectrum of interesting global customers. You have a solid understanding of modern PHP. You may also have roots in modern JavaScript — either front-end application frameworks or Node.js. You will never stop learning. You have a willingness to rapidly learn new technologies. You have excellent written English and can effectively communicate with customers, sometimes under stressful circumstances. Communication is our oxygen and the basis of everything we do. You like actively solving problems. You are excited by the idea of deep, collaborative problem-solving on a regular basis and motivated by the prospect of what you’ll learn along the way. You may have experience with some of the following: software engineering industry standards across the full lifecycle, coding standards and team coding practices, source control (primarily Git), build processes, testing methodologies, and cloud infrastructures.     What to Expect  We know applying to jobs can be stressful and we want to ease the stress by giving clear expectations up front about what to expect from our process. We’ve outlined everything you need to know here including all of the steps in the process as well as how we approach hiring on our How We Hire page (https://automattic.com/how-we-hire/). We’re always iterating so if you happen to join us in the process, please feel free to offer feedback on what else we can include there!     About the Team  We are first and foremost engineers, though our backgrounds and experiences in life and career vary. We typically have a deep background in either WordPress development itself (some of us are long time developers/contributors, experienced themers and plugin developers) and/or the web (others of us are devs with backgrounds in media or general technology.) All of us have a deep interest in code, learning and a commitment to open source, WordPress and the future of the open web.     We are also passionate advocates for our customers. We are unafraid of ambiguous or challenging situations involving code, humans or both. We understand the wider and human contexts of technical decisions. We are able to communicate effectively across cultures and organizations, sometimes in difficult situations. We are most engaged when solving truly interesting problems collaboratively. We care about our customers, and share a commitment to helping them achieve their goals!     Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at WordPress VIP / Automattic  We’re improving diversity, equity, and inclusion in the tech industry. At Automattic, we want people to love their work and show respect and empathy to all. We welcome differences and strive to increase participation from traditionally underrepresented groups. Our DEI committee involves Automatticians across the company and drives grassroots change. For example, this group has helped facilitate private online spaces for affiliated Automatticians to gather and helps run a monthly DEI People Lab series for further learning. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is a priority at Automattic, though our dedication influences far more than just Automatticians: We make our products freely available and translate our products into and offer customer support in numerous languages. We require unconscious bias training for our hiring teams and ensure our products are accessible across different bandwidths and devices.  Show more Show less']"
