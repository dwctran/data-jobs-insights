We process payments, power marketplaces, disburse payroll and loans, provide KYC solutions, prevent fraud, and help businesses grow exponentially. We serve our customers by providing a suite of world-class APIs, eCommerce platform integrations, and easy to use applications for individual entrepreneurs, SMEs, and enterprises alike.  Our main focus is building the most advanced payment rails for Southeast Asia, with a clear goal in mind — to make payments across in SEA simple, secure and easy for everyone. We serve thousands of businesses ranging from SMEs to multinational enterprises, and process millions of transactions monthly. We’ve been growing rapidly since our inception in 2015, onboarding hundreds of new customers every month, and backed by global top-10 VCs. We’re proud to be featured on among the fastest growing companies by Y-Combinator.  Experiments Team  The Experiments team builds new products that are complementary to our existing suite of digital infrastructure. We take ideas, customer pain points, or gaps in the market and build a new solution from the ground up. This team presents a unique opportunity for people who are looking to build something completely new, rather than improving existing products.  As the name suggests, these products are experimental, meaning they sometimes fail. We’re therefore looking for people who can quickly recognize failure, take feedback and iterate immediately, even if it means leaving behind our previous dreams of what the product could look like.  Marketplace  The experiment you will be working on is a marketplace to help customers discover Xendit’s products. Xendit’s products empower merchants with the tools to collect and disburse payments, manage a storefront, get financed and much, much more. As an engineer on the marketplace, you’ll build a platform that integrates all of Xendit’s products intuitively and seamlessly while helping customers discover the right tools at the right place.  More than this, you will create a platform for fellow developers to build on top of Xendit’s core products (not unlike Shopify of Slack’s developer tools). We want to build an ecosystem of apps that businesses in Southeast Asia can use.  You’ll work with a group of designers, engineers and Product Manager to build a best-in-class product. You may have to collaborate with the rest of the engineering team to understand technical feasibility and blockers.  Responsibilities   Build tech solutions with scalability and best practices in mind Collaborate with Product Manager and engineering teams to build products that scale and drive our metrics Build tooling to help us do that easier Help guide business requirements with technical feasibility and constraints Do whatever it takes to make Xendit succeed   You may be a good fit if:   2+ years of a successful track record of developing quality software products and shipping production-ready software Bachelor's or Master's degree, preferably in Computer Science, or equivalent experience Demonstrated knowledge of modern full stack web development preferably using React, component driven development, NodeJS, Typescript/Golang, postgreSQL and pub/sub design patterns Experience with Docker and containerization Experience with unit, integration, and E2E test frameworks preferably with Jest Experience with Agile development Ability to break down complex business requirements into technical requirements Ability to architect distributed systems on cloud computing platforms Thrive on being independent and have proven you can push towards a goal by yourself Ability to communicate clearly and effectively Show more Show less""]"
